Description :

I was able to create a simple snake game with only one square as the
the length of the snake, also i added a score and gameover screen.

How to paly ?

It is very easy game to play, just use arrow up, down, right and left to move the snake 
and achieve the highest score possible.

Future work:

I hope i can be able to add some audio for everytime the snake eats the food. 

Challenge:

the most difficult challenge to be able to increase the snake length without any issues.
